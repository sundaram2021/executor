// Org-slug URL canonicalization for org-scoped hosts (cloud, self-host,
// cloudflare). Console routes live under an optional `{-$orgSlug}` segment, so
// the same tree serves `/policies` and `/acme/policies`; this gate, mounted
// inside the authenticated shell, pins the URL to the ACTIVE organization's
// slug:
//
//   - bare URL            → replace with `/<active-slug>/…` (canonicalize)
//   - active slug in URL  → render
//   - other slug in URL   → `foreignSlug(slug)` when provided (cloud renders a
//                           switch-organization resolver); single-org hosts
//                           omit it and the slug reads as a wrong address —
//                           a NOT-FOUND page, never a silent redirect into a
//                           workspace the URL didn't name
//
// "Foreign" is judged against where the SESSION has been, not just the URL:
// when the active slug changes while mounted (an org create/switch elsewhere
// in the app re-resolves `/account/me`), the URL is the stale side and
// canonicalizes forward. Treating that as a foreign URL would switch the
// session straight back — racing the in-flight navigation and rotating the
// session cookie twice (WorkOS sealed-session refreshes are single-use, so
// the loser of that race invalidates the winner).
//
// The URL slug is a SELECTOR, not a trust boundary — every API call is scoped
// by the session server-side, same as the MCP URL-pinned org.

// Autumn surface: read the usage events the target ACTUALLY tracked to its
// billing backend. Metering is fire-and-forget (the engine decorator forks the
// `autumn.track` call so billing can't stall a user-facing execution), so "this
// execution was billed" is an eventually-consistent fact that lives in Autumn's
// ledger, not in the execution's own response. This surface reads that ledger
// from the suite's Autumn emulator: the layer where a "we silently stopped
// metering" regression (the unmetered MCP plane these scenarios pin) is actually
// observable. A missing track looks identical to health from the product side,
// so the contract has to be pinned where the usage is read.
